# The master for this script exists in the Python '2.7' directory. Do
# not edit the version of this script found in other directories. When
# the version of the script in the Python '2.7' directory is modified,
# it must then be be copied into other directories. This is necessary as
# Docker when building an image cannot copy in a file from outside of
# the directory where the Dockerfile resides.

# Record everything that is run from this script so appears in logs.

# Ensure that any failure within this script causes this script to fail
# immediately. This eliminates the need to check individual statuses for
# anything which is run and prematurely exit. Note that the feature of
# bash to exit in this way isn't foolproof. Ensure that you heed any
# advice in:
#
#   http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
#   http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Error_handling
#
# and use best practices to ensure that failures are always detected.
# Any user supplied scripts should also use this failure mode.

# Install all the dependencies that we need in order to be able to build
# both Python and Apache from source code, and then build additional
# modules for each. This is still a slim install. If additional packages
# are needed based on users code, such as database clients, they should
# be installed by the user from the build hooks.
